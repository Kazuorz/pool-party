# Pool Party

My first project as a front-end developer, looking to build a comfortable way to search for "beatmaps" of a rhythm game called "osu!".
This will also allow users to put together what is called a "Map pool" to easily present them to the players, making the Tournament environment much easier to manage.

This app uses an API built by agonzalezmurua in https://github.com/agonzalezmurua/pool-party-api which makes use of the osu!api v2 to work.

Huge WIP right now so stay tuned!
